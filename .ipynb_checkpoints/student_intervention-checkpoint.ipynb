Where the model will determine which group belong to each new student. We can justify our response as soon as we understand that the goal is the separation of data into two groups, so the model output must have a discrete value (group 1 or group 2) only achieved with classification. If that were the case to predict the score of the students based on the features we have, the model would have to return continuos data with the pontuation, something that is typical for models that use regression."

    "**Answer: ** The models chosen that I found suitable for the problem were: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees(DT) and Naive Bayes (NB). The choice of models was based on the success of these algorithms in studies in the scientific literature as being trustworthy for classification problems. As the data set provided to the problem is not a large sample (only 395 individuals) I tried to choose methods that work well with small data sets but have good performance. We can do a little evaluation of each model as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Support Vector Machines  **\n",
    "\n",
    " - General Applications: The SVM is a supervised learning model that generates input-output functions for mapping a set of data that its function can be either a classification function or a regression function. In classification problems, non-linear kernel functions are often used to transform the input data to a high-dimensional space characteristic in which the input data become separable compared with the original input space creating maximum hyperplane margin.\n",
    "        \n",
    " - Strengths: Some of its advantages are that SVM is very effective in high-dimensional spaces, and in situations when have a non-linear separation problem. With SVM we have the possibility to apply new kernels that allows flexibility for our decision boundaries, leading to a better classification performance.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Weaknesses: It does not have good performance when we have heterogenous datasets and many independent features, and datasets with a lot of data. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " **2) Decision Trees  **\n",
    "\n",
    " - General Applications: A decision tree is a supervised learning model supported by a decision-making method that is a graphical representation of alternatives available from an initial decision.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Strengths: Some of its advantages are the solid performance in very large databases, it is a model of easy interpretation and follows philosophy white box indicating the transparency from its boolean decision profile. Other great advantage of a decision trees is the possibility of decomposition of a complex problem in several simpler sub-problems. Recursively, a new identified sub-problems can again broken down into even simpler sub-problems.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Weaknesses: It has disadvantages as the formation, complexity and size of its trees, which compromises the generalization of the model and can cause overfitting.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " **3) Naive Bayes  **\n",
    "\n",
    " - General Applications: The Naive Bayes model calculates the probability that an unknown sample belongs to one of the possible classes submitted by the problem, or predict your most likely class. We can consider this model as being  completely based on probabilistic calculation. It is  called \"naive\", considering that the effect of the value of a feature on a given class is independent of the values of other other features.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Strengths: Between some of its advantages is that with a conditional independence assumption a Naive Bayes classifier can converge quicker than discriminative models having a reduced need of a large set of training data.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Weaknesses: The same conditional independence assumption can be a disadvantage when if you have no occurrences of a class label and a feature value together, what will give you a zero frequency-based value probability that affects any posterior probability estimate.\n",

    "### Implementation: Model Performance Metrics\n",
    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",

    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",

    "   Despite presenting a bit slower training and prediction performance (up to four times higher in prediction time, and six times in training time) if compared to the other methods, we can choose the SVM as the best model for this case, even because the SVM model compensates its slower performance (something that may later be re-evaluated with a better selection of features used in the model. A reassessment of the features can reduce their number to only those features that are really important to the prediction process.Thus increasing it's performance) with a more satisfactory prediction rate even when we have a set of small training data as can be seen from the result of prediction rates for 100 individuals data sample: SVM (0.7662), NB (0.6393) and DT (0.6387). Revealing that the SVM is also a better choice for when we have a scenario of a limited number of available data.\n",

    "The model works as a football coach before his team. The coach's role is to predict in the locker room which athletes in a newly arrived group of new players should be better to play on offense and which will be playing on defense. To be able to predict, the coach must then train with his team before every game to learn the skills of their players who were already on the team and he already separates between which athlete play on offense, and which play in defense, previously eliminating the injured players or out of shape that undermine the team's performance. After training with his team of known players the coach will know, with some degree of certainty, what the right characteristics to predict which of the new players are good on offense or defense.\n",
    "The model chosen to classify students likely to suffer intervention or not, was the Support Vector Machines. The model will base their decisions, as well as the coach, in their data sets (players) and the features that describe them (characteristics of athletes). And these data shall be processed by a previous exploration to eliminate any occurrence that may decrease the effectiveness of the model (missing data, for example), which is analogous to the coach eliminating athletes with problems that might hinder the team. After the selected data, the model will undergo a training process to meet the data (players) and their features (skills). From the training results the data is then divided into a dimensional space (which would be the locker room) by a function that gets the best result to predict the behavior of new data submitted to the model.
